# Learn-Go

> Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C,        > but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[5] and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former        > domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.

You can find Go Lang examples, exercises, and codes to the my initial plan is to make a Go comprehensive guide.</br>
> This repo is dedicated to teach and share my experience with Go programming language for beginners and it's aimed to be an open source project. 
> For now I'll not accept any PR's. Leave a ðŸŒŸ if you like the idea.
